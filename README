# Collection of Tools and Utilities #

Contains scripts and utilities for common tasks that I wrote myself (or
stole in parts from other people).
Feel free to copy/borrow/help yourself.

If you find anything particularly useful, drop me a line!

Contents:

* archive_images.py: recurses through source directories, picks image files
  and copies them by creation date into a directory tree destination/YYYY/MM
